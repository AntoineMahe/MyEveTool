utilities for industry in eve online

Goals :
    -> interface to quickly get information for market decision
        > for exemple what is the price of that item in that system, on average ... over the last month etc.
        > how do it cost to make that item in industry (main feature and first goal for the project)
        > how many  times a fday that item is sold
        > who sold , who buy
    -> displaying and interecting for that stuff (like html display) ...

Secondary concerns :
    -> cross plateform (os independant)
    -> keep it simple

I use the python-eveapi in python from https://code.google.com/p/python-eveapi/ to interface with the eve online public API.
